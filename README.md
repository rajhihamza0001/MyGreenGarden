# MyGreenGarden
Precision irrigation system installed in my garden. The system is equipped with an  air, soil temperature  and humidity  sensors. It collects and sends  data to an intelligent server. We can analyse the status of the plant based on these data and send an irrigation order to give it the necessary water quantities  in order to have the optimal production. It is also equipped with a sensor for light quantities to measure the plant activity rate . We can check the collected  data in real time  via a Web or Android application (My green garden) , and the  monthly and annual  history.
